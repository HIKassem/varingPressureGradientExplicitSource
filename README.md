# varingPressureGradientExplicitSource
Creates a time-varying pressure gradient source.
This code is based on the original
 pressureGradientExplicitSource but incorporating the DataEntry class is the same way as fixedTemperatureConstraint class.


pressureGradientExplicitSource sourc code:
https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.4.x/tree/master/src/fvOptions/sources/derived/pressureGradientExplicitSource

fixedTemperatureConstraint source code:
https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.4.x/tree/master/src/fvOptions/constraints/derived/fixedTemperatureConstraint



This modification is based on a discussion on CFD-online with Mr. Mahmoud Aboukhedr:

This code is not fully tested yet and should be used with caution!
